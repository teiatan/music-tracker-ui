## Local Development

To run the app locally:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file based on the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

> If you donâ€™t create a `.env` file, the app assumes the backend runs at `http://localhost:8000`, and the frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```
